Structural Bioinformatics Investigation of the MAPK/ERK Signalling Pathway in Melanoma

## Overview
This repository contains the project files for structural bioinformatics investigation into the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway in melanoma. The primary focus is on understanding the structure and function of critical proteins within this pathway and identifying potential inhibitors that can serve as therapeutic agents for melanoma.

## Introduction

The MAPK/ERK pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals through a series of phosphorylation events. Dysregulation in this pathway, often due to mutations in the BRAF or RAS genes, leads to unregulated cell proliferation seen in many cancers, including melanoma. The project focuses on the structural analysis of key proteins in this pathway (Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK), and the identification of potential inhibitors through molecular docking studies.


## Methodology
1. **Protein Structure Retrieval:** Protein structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
    - BRAF (3OG7)
    - MEK1 (3E8N)
    - ERK2 (6OPH)
    - MKP3 (1MKP)

2. **Structural Analysis and Classification:** Detailed structural analysis including secondary structure visualization and ligand-binding site identification.

3. **Homology Modeling:** Predicted 3D structures of proteins not available in the PDB using Swiss-Model server.

4. **Molecular Docking:** Docking studies to identify potential inhibitors using AutoDock Vina.

5. **Visualization and Analysis:** Visualization of protein-ligand interactions using PyMOL.

## Results
- **Docking Results:** Identified top ligands with high binding affinities for BRAF and MEK1 proteins.
- **Interaction Analysis:** Detailed visualization and analysis of key residues involved in ligand binding and potential interactions.

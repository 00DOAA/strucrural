# Lead Concentration Analysis Project
## Project Overview

This project, part of the Biomedical Statistics course, aims to analyze lead concentration data. The analysis involves descriptive statistics, graphical representations, and hypothesis testing to understand the distribution and relationship of lead concentration across various demographic factors.
## Introduction

Lead exposure is a significant public health concern, especially in children. This project aims to analyze lead concentration data to understand its distribution and potential factors influencing it.

## Data

The data used in this project includes various demographic and lead concentration measurements. The key variables analyzed are:
- **Area**
- **Sex**
- **Lead Type**
- **Exposure Levels**
- **Maximum Finger Tapping (MAXWT)**
- **Lead concentration at different times (Ld72, Ld73)**

## Methods

### Descriptive Statistics
- Data identification and exploration using functions like `str()` and `summary()`.
- Computation of central tendency measures (mean, median) and quartiles.
- Frequency tables for categorical variables.
- Correlation coefficients for continuous variables.

### Graphical Representations
- Bar charts for categorical variables (e.g., gender).
- Histograms for continuous variables (e.g., age, MAXWT).
- Scatterplots with regression lines for relationships between variables.
- Boxplots for visualizing data spread and identifying outliers.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Normality tests using histograms, Shapiro test, and Q-Q plots.
- Homoscedasticity tests using Boxplot, Bartlett’s test, and Levene’s test.
